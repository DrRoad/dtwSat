[dtwSat](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dtwSat/index.html) implements the Time-Weighted Dynamic Time Warping (TWDTW) for multi-band satellite image time series analysis. It includes methods for analysis and visualization of results and for land use and land cover changes analysis. In this chapter we show the usage of [dtwSat](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dtwSat/index.html) to perform a time series analysis and give some examples of the visualization methods. We use some predefined temporal patterns and a few samples of time series to highlight the potential of TWDTW for land use and land cover changes analysis using remote sensing time series.
