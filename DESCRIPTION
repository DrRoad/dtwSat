Description: 
    The dtwSat provides a Time-Weighted Dynamic Time Warping (TWDTW) algorithm to measure 
    similarity between two temporal sequences. This adaptation of the classical 
    Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) algorithm is flexible to compare events that have a strong 
    time dependency, such as phenological stages of cropland systems and tropical 
    forests. This package provides methods for visualization of minimum cost 
    paths and time series alignment.
