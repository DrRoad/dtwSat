Description: Provides a Time-Weighted Dynamic Time Warping (TWDTW) algorithm
    to measure similarity between two temporal sequences. This adaptation of the
    classical Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) algorithm is flexible to compare events
    that have a strong time dependency, such as phenological stages of cropland
    systems and tropical forests. This package provides methods for visualization of
    minimum cost paths, time series alignment, and time intervals classification.
